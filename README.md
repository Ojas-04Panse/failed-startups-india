## 📊 Objectives
- Create a structured dataset of failed startups
- Analyze patterns in failu  re by year, sector, and region
- Visualize failure reasons and startup lifespans
- Derive actionable business insights

## 🔍 Key Insights

🚨 1. Big Funding ≠ Success
- Startups like Spilikart ($519M) and Askme ($300M) raised huge amounts of money — but still shut down.
- In fact, over 60% of the top 10 failed startups had raised more than $100 million, showing that money alone isn’t enough if the business model doesn’t work.

🏷️ 2. Which Sectors Struggled the Most?
- E-commerce leads the failure chart with 10 startups, making up ~30% of all recorded failures.
- Fintech comes second with 6 failed startups (18%), likely due to regulatory hurdles and fierce competition.
- Edtech, Foodtech, and AI also saw notable failures, reflecting saturation and possibly post-COVID shifts in consumer behavior.

🏙️ 3. Where Are Startups Failing?
- Bengaluru is the hotspot, with 11 startup shutdowns, followed by New Delhi (7) and Gurugram (4).
- These 3 cities alone account for ~58% of all recorded failures, showing that even top startup hubs aren’t immune.
- Cities like Mumbai, Noida, and Haryana also saw multiple failures, hinting at a broader issue in urban startup ecosystems.

📅 4. Failure Over the Years
- The highest number of failures happened in 2017 (16 startups), followed by a spike again in 2024 (12 startups).
- Combined, these two years account for 40% of all failures in the dataset.
- Fewer failures are recorded from 2018 to 2022, but that might reflect underreporting or survivorship bias — not necessarily success.

❌ 5. Why Did Startups Shut Down?
- Financial issues were the most common reason, cited by 14 startups (~33%). This includes running out of cash or being unable to raise follow-up funding.
- Business model flaws and strategic missteps were also common, each affecting 6 startups (~14%).
- Other reasons included poor product-market fit, regulatory issues, and scaling problems, proving that startup failure is rarely due to just one factor.

💡 What This Tells Us
Startups don’t just need funding — they need strong execution, real market demand, and a scalable business model.
Even in cities like Bengaluru and Delhi, support systems need to focus more on mentorship, resilience, and pivoting, not just fundraising.
Investors and founders should look beyond hype — and ask: “Do people actually need this product, and will they pay for it?”
